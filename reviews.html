            <em>"The Troubles are exuberant, theatrical and hugely entertaining"</em> - Michael Mulheron, The Dominion Post

            <em>"There are bands that I like, bands that I respect and bands which drive me wild with pleasure. 'The Troubles' are of the latter kind. I'm besotted with this band and their deliberately ragged, madly political, quasi-serious satire. This band digs deep into the well-springs of life and what bubbles up is a joyous lake of barely controlled madness... Musically it was amazing fun and after a difficult week I was suddenly glad I was alive."</em><br> - John Fenton, Creative Jazz Club Aotearoa
